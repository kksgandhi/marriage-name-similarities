# Marriage-name-similarities

According to Jones (cited below), people are more likely to marry others with similar names. So a "Jacob" is more likely to marry a "Jennifer" than a "Katherine". The specific similarity used by Jones was the first letter of one's first name. Jones did his work in 2004, but nowadays far more data is available in easily accessible formats.

This repo contains code to analyze Texas marriage licenses and see if it holds true with more data.
